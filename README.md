# My-whisperdaemon-rspdevices
Setup for a PC/Laptop with Ubuntu22.04, SDRPlay devices and wsprdaemon (from rrobinett) in order to report singel band fst4w spots.
There are some changes in wsprdaemon.conf, recording.sh and decoding.sh
All changes are described in the install document, but for convenience we added the changed decoding.sh and recording.sh files.
